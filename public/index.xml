Our primary goal in founding this studio was to combine everyones ideas to produce games that we view as ethical, fully featured and are enjoyable to our entire group. As the entire gaming industry has involved over the past two decades we&amp;rsquo;ve become more and more unsettled by the growth of companies in the industry that produce unspired games soley for profit and the lack of focus on creating a fun and innovative product.</description></item></channel></rss>
