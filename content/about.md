## Introduction

Recluse Games is a studio that was founded by a small group of friends in Seattle Washington in January of 2020.

Our primary goal in founding this studio was to combine everyones ideas to produce games that we view as ethical, 
fully featured and are enjoyable to our entire group. As the entire gaming industry has involved over the past two decades
we've become more and more unsettled by the growth of companies in the industry that produce unspired games soley for profit
and the lack of focus on creating a fun and innovative product.


We Value:
* Fun and interesting concepts
* Ethical Sales and Marketing
* Innovative gameplay and development practices
* High quality of our products

## The Team

Our team is currently made up of individuals that have worked in the technology industry for a decade and have
been involved in teams and companies of various sizes.
